- **Classification**: `risk_category`  

Features include commuting time, vehicle type, location type, industry proximity, indoor air quality, and more.  

## Use Cases  

1. Train models for pollution score & risk prediction  
2. Explore missing value imputation  
3. Perform feature importance & explainability  
4. Build an urban health dashboard or app  
5. Compare rural vs urban lifestyle effects
